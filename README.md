When it comes to defining passwords we all try to get through the task in an easier manner just by adding a few alphabets or maybe even a few digits included but in present day complex passwords are required as a primary defense against unauthorized access to social media accounts, banking or any financial data or even private communications. As the complexity of a password increases possibility of Brute Forcing decreases. A strong password is a mix of alphabets in uppercase and lowercase, numbers and special characters.

Here in this code i have drafted a simple yet effective password complexity checker which does not allow us to move forward if a Simple password is entered; it requests us to modify the password at least to a Moderate level.
Further it prompts a warning message if consecutive special characters have been used like for example '### or &&&'. When a complex password is entered that is with an uppercase alphabet, a lowercase alphabet, a number and a special character, it allows us to move forward right away.
